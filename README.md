# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
#College Project During our 6th sem 
BE in Computer Science Engineering
This mini project is designed to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of patient health records and makes predictions based on user input provided through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## üîç Project Features

- Clean and interactive GUI built using Python's Tkinter.
- Trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
- Accepts user input for key health parameters.
- Displays prediction result in a simplified manner: **Disease Present** or **No Disease**.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

  ## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
