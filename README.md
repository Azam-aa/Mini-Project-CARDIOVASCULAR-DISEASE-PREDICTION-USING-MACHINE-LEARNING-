# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini project is designed to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of patient health records and makes predictions based on user input provided through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## üîç Project Features

- Clean and interactive GUI built using Python's Tkinter.
- Trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
- Accepts user input for key health parameters.
- Displays prediction result in a simplified manner: **Disease Present** or **No Disease**.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
