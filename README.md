# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini project is designed to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of patient health records and makes predictions based on user input provided through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
